Jalali DateTime Class, supports years higher than 2038
by: Sallar Kaboli

Requires PHP >= 5.2

PHP's default 'date' function does not support years higher than
2038. Intorduced in PHP5, DateTime class supports higher years 
and also invalid date entries. 
Also, Persian users are using classic 'jdate' function for years now
and beside the fact that it's amazing and also helped me to write this
one, it's really out of date, and can't be used in modern real world
web applications as it is completely written in functions.
