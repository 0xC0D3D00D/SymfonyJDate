# About jDateTime

Jalali DateTime Class, supports years higher than 2038  
by: Sallar Kaboli  
 
Requires PHP >= 5.2 

PHP's default 'date' function does not support years higher than  
2038. Intorduced in PHP5, DateTime class supports higher years  
and also invalid date entries.  
Also, Persian users are using classic 'jdate' function for years now  
and beside the fact that it's amazing and also helped me to write this  
one, it's really out of date, and can't be used in modern real world  
web applications as it is completely written in functions.
